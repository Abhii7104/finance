## About The Project

The `finance` repository contains a straightforward, single-page HTML application (`index.html`) focused on delivering basic financial functionalities or information. Given its simplicity and client-side nature, it's an ideal starting point for anyone looking to understand web development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in the context of personal finance.

While currently containing only `index.html`, the project is designed to be easily extensible. Future enhancements could include interactive calculators for budgeting, compound interest, loan payments, currency conversion, or even simple data visualization of financial trends.

This project aims to be:
*   **Simple:** Easy to understand and modify for beginners.
*   **Accessible:** Runs directly in any modern web browser without server-side dependencies.
*   **Extensible:** A solid base for building more complex financial tools.

---

## Features

As a basic HTML project, `index.html` currently provides:

*   A foundational web page structure for financial content.
*   (Potentially) Basic informational display related to finance.
*   (Placeholder for future expansion) Interactive elements for simple financial calculations (e.g., basic budgeting, simple interest calculation, or a placeholder for future JavaScript-driven features).

*Note: Specific features will depend on the content implemented within `index.html`.*

## Usage

Since this is a client-side HTML application, you can open it directly in your web browser.

1.  **Open the `index.html` file:**
    Locate the `index.html` file in the `finance` directory you just cloned.
    Double-click `index.html` or drag it into your web browser.

    Alternatively, from your terminal:
    *   **On macOS:**

        open index.html
        ```
    *   **On Windows (using `start` command in PowerShell/CMD):**

    *   **On Linux (using `xdg-open`):**
        ```bash
        xdg-open index.html
        ```
